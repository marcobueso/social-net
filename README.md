# social-net
Project using Python Flask to create a Social Network

Followed along freeCodeCamp.org's video: "Full stack Python Flask tutorial - Build a social network"

Learned about sqlite3 (which comes integrated with Python) and used it to create a database with an SQL schema.
Had a models.py function which was used by my main app.py.

I intend to keep working on this and hopefully one day find a cool purpose for the "social network". Ideas are welcome!
